# autograder

Automatically loop through a directory of student codes running (and testing) a set function.

**Warning!!** This script pretty much blindly runs whatever is in the student codes... which could include some very malicious stuff indeed. We check for "import" and "eval" keywords, which probably catches a lot of evil.
